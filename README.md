## installation
simple place slater.css in your .obsidian/themes folder and load it :)

## about
i wanted to make a theme following a colorscheme i made (i haven't uploaded that yet). it went through several stages but this is what i've arrived at

## roadmap
will add some small custom styling here and there for some plugins i use, and will add better mobile support
